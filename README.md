📊 Streamlit EDA Dashboard — Univariate & Bivariate Analysis
🚀 Overview: This project is an interactive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Dashboard built with Streamlit, designed to make data exploration simple, visual, and intuitive.
It enables users to perform both Univariate and Bivariate analysis through a clean interface — providing Non-Visual (statistical) as well as Visual (graphical) insights.

Whether you are a data analyst, data science student, or business professional, this tool helps you understand data patterns, distributions, and relationships in just a few clicks — without writing a single line of code.

🧠 Purpose: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is the foundation of every data-driven project.
This dashboard was created to:

Simplify EDA for beginners and professionals alike.

Provide instant insights through visual and non-visual representations.

Make analysis interactive and user-friendly using Streamlit’s web-based interface.

Help users detect patterns, correlations, and anomalies quickly.

🔍 Univariate Analysis

Univariate analysis focuses on examining a single variable at a time to understand its distribution and behavior.
This dashboard divides univariate analysis into two major types: Numerical and Categorical, each with non-visual and visual sections.

🧮 Numerical Columns

Non-Visual Insights:
Provides a statistical summary of each numeric column, including measures like mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.
These summaries help understand central tendency, variability, and data spread.

Visual Insights:
Visualizations are used to identify patterns and outliers easily.
Includes:

Histogram: Displays data distribution and frequency.

Box Plot: Highlights median, quartiles, and outliers.

KDE Plot: Shows smooth probability distribution for deeper insight.

🔤 Categorical Columns

Non-Visual Insights:
Displays category frequency using value counts, allowing quick understanding of dominant or rare categories.

Visual Insights:
Presents category proportions and comparisons visually through:

Count Plot: Displays frequency of each category clearly.

Pie Chart: Represents relative proportions of each category.

🔗 Bivariate Analysis

Bivariate analysis studies the relationship between two variables to understand how one variable influences or relates to another.
This project supports three major types of bivariate comparisons — with both non-visual summaries and interactive visual plots.

🔹 Numerical vs Numerical

Non-Visual Insights:
Shows correlation coefficients to measure the strength and direction of relationships between numeric features.

Visual Insights:
Helps users visualize numeric relationships effectively through:

Scatter Plot: Reveals linear or nonlinear relationships.

Heatmap: Displays correlation intensity between multiple numeric variables.

🔹 Numerical vs Categorical

Non-Visual Insights:
Summarizes numerical data grouped by categories, giving aggregated metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation for each group.

Visual Insights:
Offers multiple plot types for comparing numeric values across categories:

Box Plot: Displays variation across categories.

Violin Plot: Combines box plot with density information.

Grouped Histogram: Compares numeric spread for each category.

🔹 Categorical vs Categorical

Non-Visual Insights:
Provides cross-tabulated data (contingency tables) showing relationships between two categorical features.

Visual Insights:
Utilizes grouped count plots to present frequency combinations and patterns between categories visually.

🧩 Key Features

🧰 Tools and Technologies

Python — Core programming language.

Streamlit — For building the interactive web application.

Pandas — For data manipulation and analysis.

Seaborn — For advanced statistical data visualization.

📂 Dataset

The dashboard uses the tips_updated.csv dataset for demonstration purposes.
However, users can upload any CSV dataset of their choice and explore it seamlessly within the app.

💡 Project Outcome

This Streamlit dashboard bridges the gap between manual coding and intuitive analysis.
It enables users to:

Perform in-depth EDA with ease.

Visualize relationships and trends instantly.

Save time during the initial data exploration phase.

Make informed decisions based on real insights.

🔮 Future Enhancements

Addition of multivariate (3+ variable) analysis.

Customizable color themes and advanced filtering options.

Export functionality for plots and summary reports.

Integration with machine learning models for predictive insights.
